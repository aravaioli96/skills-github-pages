#NPM

## NAME
npm - npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

## SYNOPSIS
```
npm <command> [args]
```
## DESCRIPTION
npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently.

It is extremely configurable to support a variety of use cases. Most commonly, you use it to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.

Run `npm help` to get a list of available commands.
